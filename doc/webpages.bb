[b]Creating Web Pages[/b]

Red enables users to create static webpages.  To activate this feature, enable the web pages feature in your Additional Features section.

Once enabled, a new tab will appear on your channel page labelled &quot;Webpages&quot;.  Clicking this link will take you to the webpage editor.  Here you can create a post using either BBCode or the rich text editor.

Pages will be accessible at mydomain/page/username/pagelinktitle

The &quot;page link title&quot; box allows a user to specify the &quot;pagelinktitle&quot; of this URL.  If no page link title is set, we will set one for you automatically, using the message ID of the item.  

Beneath the page creation box, a list of existing pages will appear with an &quot;edit&quot; link.  Clicking this will take you to an editor, similar to that of the post editor, where you can make changes to your webpages.

If you are the admin of a site, you can specify a channel whose webpages we will use at key points around the site.  Presently, the only place this is implemented is the home page.  If you specify the channel &quot;admin&quot; and then the channel called &quot;admin&quot; creates a webpage called &quot;home&quot;, we will display it's content on your websites home page.  We expect this functionality to be extended to other areas in future.
