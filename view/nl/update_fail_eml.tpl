Hey, 
I'm the RedMatrix hub at {{$sitename}};
   
The Red atrix developers released update {{$update}} recently, 
but when I tried to install it, something went terribly wrong.  
This needs to be fixed soon and it requires human intervention. 
Please contact a RedMatrix developer if you can not figure out how to 
fix it on your own. My database might be invalid. 

The error message is '{{$error}}'.   

Apologies for the inconvenience, 
	your hub at {{$siteurl}}
